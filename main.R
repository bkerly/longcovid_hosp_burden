# The purpose of this script is to generate some nice tables and graphs for the 2023 long COVID burden estimate

# Load packages
library(tidyverse) # Good for data manipulation
library(ggthemes) # Good for making graphs cute
library(lubridate) # Makes dates easier
library(readxl) # Import excel files
library(table1) # Does table 1 without having to mess around a lot

# load data, do dates--------------
# Import denominator data

  # Redo the dates so R understands them as dates
  mutate(month = ymd(paste0(

    dischargeyear,
    "/",
    dischargemonth,
    "/",
    "1"

  select(-dischargeyear, -dischargemonth)

#Import count data
